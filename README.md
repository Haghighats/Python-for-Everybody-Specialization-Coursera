Welcome to my Python learning journey!

In this repository, I'm sharing the key practices I encountered for the first time while learning Python. These are the amazing microlearning techniques that Dr. Charles Severance (aka Dr. Chuck) used to make our Python programming journey truly fun and effective.

I hope you find this repository helpful and that your Python learning experience is just as rewarding as mine!
